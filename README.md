# CS2600_FinalProject
This is the final project for Spring 2022 CS2600 with Professor Davarpanah

The purpose of the project is to learn to use the ESP32 and integrate MQTT with it.
Competence is demonstrated in two parts:

Part 1: Using MQTT to remotely enable or disable an LED connected to the ESP32 at the press 
of either 1 or 2 on the remote console.

Part 2: Create a program that automates calls to the ESP32 via MQTT. This part was given
as a free response problem of sorts.
